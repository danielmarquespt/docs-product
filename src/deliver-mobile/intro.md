# Delivering Mobile Apps

Once your mobile app has reached a stable state you probably want to create a mobile application package and distribute it to the users to run it.

In OutSystems, you can generate a mobile application package \(IPA and APK\) for a target mobile operating system \(iOS and Android\) by only providing the configurations. No need to install the SDK for each target mobile operating system. The configurations you should provide may differ according to the way you want to distribute your application to users and according to the mobile platform. Check the iOS and Android documentation to learn more about the distribution options.
