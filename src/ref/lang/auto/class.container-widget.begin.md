# Class.Container Widget.begin

Container "box" where you can drag and drop other widgets, including other containers, to organize the layout of the screen.

Containers allow you to:

* Group content with the same layout \(style, position, etc.\)
* Group content with the same behavior \(for example, content that must be visible or hidden in the screen at the same time\)
* Create a nested structure of content
