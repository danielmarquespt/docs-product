# Class.Show Record Widget.begin

Displays a single record of an Entity or a Structure.

 The layout of the Show Record widget is implemented in a tabular way, which limits the organization of the inputs and its captions. The \[Form widget\]\(\) implements the same functionality with a more flexible layout. Use the \[Form widget\]\(\) instead of the Show Record widget to display a single record of an Entity or a Structure.
