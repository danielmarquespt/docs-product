# Class.Raise Exception.begin

Use this tool to throw an exception \(you can select an existing exception or create a new one\). If you create a new exception you can customize the message show to the end-user. This is an element that ends the action flow, so it is not possible to define new actions after it - use the Exception Handler tool to continue the execution.
