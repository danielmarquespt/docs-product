Use the Dropdown Widget to create drop-down lists in your Mobile and Reactive Web Apps.

With the Dropdown Widget you can implement two types of lists:

* Simple list with text only, when you set **Options Content** to **Text Only**. These is the most common type of lists, rendered with the `<select>` HTML tag. It provides native look and feel in the devices.
* Custom list with other Widgets, when you set **Options Content** to **Custom**. Use them to build a list from, for example, images or other widgets. These lists are rendered with the `<div>` HTML tag.
