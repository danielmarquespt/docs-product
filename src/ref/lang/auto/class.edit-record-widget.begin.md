# Class.Edit Record Widget.begin

Allows the user to create or edit a single record of an Entity or a Structure.

 The layout of the Edit Record widget is implemented in a tabular way, which limits the organization of the inputs and its captions. The \[Form widget\]\(\) implements the same functionality with a more flexible layout. Use the \[Form widget\]\(\) instead of the Edit Record widget to create or edit a single record of an Entity or a Structure.
