# ServiceStudio.Plugin.Widgets.Label.begin

Provides a caption to the input fields describing the information that is being requested from the user.

Both Label and Text widgets can be used as a caption for the inputs. However, the Label widget provides better usability and accessibility because it is bound to the input. The input is activated by clicking on the text of the Label.
