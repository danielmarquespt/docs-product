# ServiceStudio.Plugin.NRWidgets.Button.begin

Provides a button that users can click or tap to trigger an action, submit data or navigate to another screen.

If the button belongs to a form with some input fields, the button submits the information if you set **Is Form Default** property to **Yes** in the Button Widget. This is useful when you have several buttons in your form.
