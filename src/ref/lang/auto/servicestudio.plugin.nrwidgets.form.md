| Property | Name of an attribute to add to the HTML translation for this element. |  |  | You can pick a property from the drop-down list or type a free text. The name of the property will not be validated by the platform.  Duplicated properties are not allowed. Spaces, " or ' are also not allowed. |
| Value | Value of the attribute. |  |  | You can type the value directly or write expressions using the Expression Editor.  If the Value is empty, the corresponding HTML tag is created as property="property". For example, the nowrap property does not require a value, therefore nowrap="nowrap" is added. |
