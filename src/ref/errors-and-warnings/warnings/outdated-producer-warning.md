# Outdated Producer Warning

Message : `Producer '<producer>' uses outdated references. Please republish '<producer>' to prevent runtime errors`

Cause : Your current module \(e.g.: MyModule\) has one or more references to another module \(e.g.: Module1\) which is referencing other producers that have changed since it \(Module1\) was last published.

Recommendation : Republish Module1 to refresh its references, and retry MyModule publishing, afterwards.
