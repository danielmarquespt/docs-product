# Unused Attribute Warning

Message : `Consider deleting the value <value>. Itâ€™s never used because it refers to the missing attribute <attribute>.`

Cause : A value is set for an attribute that no longer exists for the given Entity.

Recommendation : Delete the value entry from the inline record properties. Additionally, verify that the deletion of the attribute is intended, and not accidental.
