# Physical Table Name Changed Warning

Message : `Entity <entity> physical table name was set to <table'> because an external table name <table> already exists.`

Cause : The name of the physical table name associated to the entity already exists in the database. Service Studio automatically renamed the physical table name to `<table'>` to avoid name clashing in the database.
