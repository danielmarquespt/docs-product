# No Error Handling Warning

Message : `Errors are not being handled in the web flow. Add error handlers or select a theme with error handling`

Cause : The web flow does not have Error Handlers, and the theme does not have a web flow for error handling.

Recommendation : Change the web flow to implement Error Handlers, or change the Error Handling Flow property of the Theme to use a web flow that already implements error handling.
