# Missing File Warning

Message : `The file '<file>' was not found on the file system.`

Cause : During the [creation of the extension](https://github.com/danielmarquespt/docs-product/tree/e7ea3f444d5129dab245c69ab72ae091554bc4fb/src/extensibility-and-integration/integration-studio/extension-life-cycle/extension-create.md%3E), [merge](https://github.com/danielmarquespt/docs-product/tree/e7ea3f444d5129dab245c69ab72ae091554bc4fb/src/extensibility-and-integration/integration-studio/extension-life-cycle/extension-update-source-code.md%3E) or save that file, which was previously added as a [resource](https://github.com/danielmarquespt/docs-product/tree/e7ea3f444d5129dab245c69ab72ae091554bc4fb/src/ref/integration-studio/resources-tree.md%3E), was not found.
