# Incompatible Action Error

The `Incompatible Action Error` error is issued in the following situation:

* `The '<action>' Server Action cannot be used with the '<soap_service_name>' consumed SOAP Web Service created in OutSystems 11. Use the SOAP Extensibility API instead.`

  The EnhancedWebReferences API was deprecated in OutSystems 11 and cannot be used to customize the behavior of consumed SOAP Web Services created in OutSystems 11.  
  OutSystems 11 includes a new implementation of consumed SOAP Web Services for all services that were not upgraded from earlier versions. This implementation is not compatible with the deprecated EnhancedWebReferences API.

  To extend and customize the behavior of consumed SOAP Web Services created in OutSystems 11 you must use the [SOAP Extensibility API](../../apis/soap-extensibility-api.md).
