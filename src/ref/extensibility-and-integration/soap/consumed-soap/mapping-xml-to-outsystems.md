# Mapping XML Data Types to OutSystems Data Types

When consuming SOAP Web Services in your module, OutSystems maps the XML Data Types into OutSystems Data Types as follows:

| XML Data Types | OutSystems Data Types |
| :--- | :--- |
| anySimpleType %%anyAtomicType %%anyType %%anyURI | Text %%Text %%Text %%Text |
| bool %%boolean %%base64Binary %%byte %%bytev | Boolean %%Boolean %%Binary %%Integer %%Integer |
| char | Integer |
| choice | Static Entity + Structure \(check Notes\) |
| date %%dateTime %%dateTimeStamp %%decimal %%double %%duration %%dayTimeDuration %%yearMonthDuration | Date %%Date Time %%Date Time %%Text %%Text %%Text %%Text %%Text |
| ENTITY %%ENTITIES %%enum | Text %%Text %%Static Entity \(check Notes\) |
| float | Text |
| gDay %%gMonth %%gMonthDay %%gYearMonth %%gYear | Text %%Text %%Text %%Text %%Text |
| hexBinary | Binary |
| ID %%IDREF %%IDREFS %%int %%integer | Text %%Text %%Text %%Integer %%Text |
| language %%long | Text %%Long Integer |
| Microsoft Datasets | Text |
| Name %%NCName %%negativeInteger %%NMTOKEN %%NMTOKENS %%nonNegativeInteger %%nonPositiveInteger %%normalizedString %%NOTATION | Text %%Text %%Text %%Text %%Text %%Text %%Text %%Text %%Text |
| Object | Text |
| positiveInteger | Text |
| QName | Text |
| short %%signed byte %%string | Integer %%Integer %%Text |
| time %%token | Time %%Text |
| unsignedByte %%unsignedInt %%unsignedLong %%unsignedShort | Integer %%Long Integer %%Decimal %%Integer |
| XML Element | Text |
| XSD Arrays | List %%In OutSystems, a List is a sequence of elements of any data type. Therefore, an XSD array is mapped into a list of records which elements are a structure that represents those elements in the XSD array. If you have an XSD array of integers, the mapping in Service Studio is a List of structures with one attribute of type Integer. |
| XSD Complex data types | Record |
| \(Other types\) | Text |

## Notes

Enumerations : Enumerations will be created as OutSystems read-only static entities with a name like `Enum_<TypeName>`. Attributes of elements that are `enum`'s will have its data type set to Enum Static Entity Identifier.

Choices : Choices will also be created as read-only static entities but with a name like `Choice_<ElementName>`. Along with this static entity, OutSystems will also create a structure to represent the `choice` element itself. This structure will have the following attributes:

* Choice, the Id of the static entity `Choice_<ElementName>`;
* An attribute for each choice option of the respective type.

  To set the value of a WSDL element of type choice, set the Choice attribute to the Id of the desired choice, and fill in the corresponding structure attribute according to the "Choice" value.

## Mapping Limitations

* Types created via "restriction" over another type are usually the same as the original type. Only the `maxLength` and `fractionDigits` restrictions are considered when creating the appropriate data types, but these restrictions are not enforced at runtime.
* Type `element` having subtype `schema` \(i.e. dynamic schemas\) is interpreted as a simple Text item.
* Type `simpleType` having subtype that is not "restriction" \(such as `list`, a space-separated sequence of text atoms\) is interpreted as a simple Text item.
* Type `complexType` having subtype that is not `sequence`, `all` or `complexContent` is interpreted as a simple Text item.
* Subtype `complexContent` that is not "restriction" or "extension" is interpreted as a simple Text item.
* SOAP Web Service annotations are ignored.
