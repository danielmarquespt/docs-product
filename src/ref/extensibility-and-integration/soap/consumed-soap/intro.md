# Consumed SOAP Web Service

This section contains reference information on the elements of consumed SOAP web services.

In [Legacy Implementation](https://github.com/danielmarquespt/docs-product/tree/e7ea3f444d5129dab245c69ab72ae091554bc4fb/src/ref/extensibility-and-integration/soap/consumed-soap/legacy/intro.md%3E) you can find reference information for the **deprecated** SOAP implementation \(supporting up to SOAP 1.1\) that is only available in modules upgraded from previous OutSystems versions.
