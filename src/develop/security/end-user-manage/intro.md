# End-User Management

Use OutSystems Users application at `http://<environment address>/Users` to create, update and delete the end-users \(users of your applications\) and manage their roles. End-users need to have the required permissions to access an application secured with authentication.

OutSystems also offers the [Users API](https://github.com/danielmarquespt/docs-product/tree/e7ea3f444d5129dab245c69ab72ae091554bc4fb/src/ref/apis/auto/users-api.final.md%3E) to access end-user management programmatically. Use the API to write your own applications for managing end-users or for exposing APIs to external systems through Web Services.

 If you use an external authentication method \(e.g., Active Directory or SAML 2.0\) to authenticate end-users, you do not need to create the users manually. Instead, they will be automatically created in the OutSystems database on the first login. Check \[End-Users Authentication\]\(end-user-authentication/intro.md\) for more information on external authentication methods.
