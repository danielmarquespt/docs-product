# Validate End-User Permissions in the Application

If you need to restrict end-user access to specific areas or operations in a web application, you must validate their permissions using roles to control access to screens, screen elements or actions.

To restrict end-user access to the screens of the application, select the end-user roles that can view the screen in the Properties editor of the screen.

To validate the permissions of end-users to screen elements or actions of the application, use the CheckRole built-in function to determine if the end-user has the necessary roles. You can use these functions to:

* Hide or display the interface elements using If elements. 
* Block or allow executing the actions.
