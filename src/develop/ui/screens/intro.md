# Screen

Screen is an interface element that has other elements for user interaction. Use Screens to create web pages and mobile screens in your apps. Add a new Screen in the **New Screen** window. A new Screen can be empty or, if created from a [Screen Template](https://github.com/danielmarquespt/docs-product/tree/e7ea3f444d5129dab245c69ab72ae091554bc4fb/src/develop/ui/screen-templates-use/intro.md%3E), have some predefined content.

You can group the Screens into **UI Flows** of the **Interface** tab. An app created from one of the default Application Templates has the default **MainFlow** UI flow.

## Create an empty Screen

Follow these steps to create an empty Screen. An empty Screen has only the basic layout.

1. On the **Interface** tab, locate **UI Flows**, and in it **MainFlow**. Right-click **MainFlow** and click **Add Screen** \(in Reactive Web and Mobile App\) or **Add Web Screen** \(in Traditional Web\). The **New Screen** window opens.
2. Select **Empty** in the list.
3. Click **Create Screen**.
