# Multilingual UI

Any application is designed using a particular language called the default language. It is in this language that the application is executed by default, however, you may have your application translated and executed in other languages, that is, a multilingual application.

Use OutSystems built-in mechanisms to [localize your Web Applications](multilingual-web.md). For mobile apps, use the [Multilingual Mobile Component](https://www.outsystems.com/forge/component/1784/multilingual-mobile-component) available in the [OutSystems Forge](https://www.outsystems.com/forge/).
