# Theme compatibility in Screen Templates

When working with Screen Templates you may see the following warning message: **The Themes are not compatible. The final Screen may look different than the preview. To use this Screen Template, you need a module with a Theme based on \(module name\)\(theme name\).** This means that your module and Screen Template are not compatible, which may cause the final page not to display correctly.

If you are using one of the [built-in Application Templates](https://github.com/danielmarquespt/docs-product/tree/e7ea3f444d5129dab245c69ab72ae091554bc4fb/src/develop/application-templates/intro.md%3E):

* Select a compatible Screen Template. All [default Screen Templates](https://www.outsystems.com/outsystems-ui/screens/>) are compatible with the [built-in Application Templates](https://github.com/danielmarquespt/docs-product/tree/e7ea3f444d5129dab245c69ab72ae091554bc4fb/src/develop/application-templates/intro.md%3E).
* [Create your own Screen Templates](https://github.com/danielmarquespt/docs-product/tree/e7ea3f444d5129dab245c69ab72ae091554bc4fb/src/develop/ui/screen-templates-create/intro.md%3E) that are based on your custom Theme.

If you are using one of the Silk UI Traditional Web Application Templates inherited from **OutSystems 10** \(Lisbon, Dublin, Liverpool, Vanilla, and Website\) or the London Theme based Application Template, Web Application:

* [Migrate your web application to OutSystems UI Web framework](https://success.outsystems.com/Support/Enterprise_Customers/Upgrading/Migrating_UI_of_the_Silk_Web_applications_to_OutSystems_UI_Framework>). The [default Screen Templates](https://www.outsystems.com/outsystems-ui/screens/>) that come bundled with OutSystems 11 are not compatible with the Silk UI nor with the London Theme.
* [Create your own Screen Templates](https://github.com/danielmarquespt/docs-product/tree/e7ea3f444d5129dab245c69ab72ae091554bc4fb/src/develop/ui/screen-templates-create/intro.md%3E) that are based on your custom Theme.

If the Screen Template was compatible with your module, but now it's not:

* Revert the changes you did to the module Theme. 
* Check if the correct Theme is set in the **Default Theme** property field of your Module/Flow.
