# Create a Process Flow

After [creating a process](../process.md#create-a-process%3E), you use a specific [editor](https://github.com/danielmarquespt/docs-product/tree/e7ea3f444d5129dab245c69ab72ae091554bc4fb/src/develop/processes/process-flow/process-flow-editor.md%3E) to design its behavior, i.e. the **process flow**. In this editor, you can select any tool available in the [Process Flow Toolbox](https://github.com/danielmarquespt/docs-product/tree/e7ea3f444d5129dab245c69ab72ae091554bc4fb/src/develop/processes/process-flow/process-flow-toolbox.md%3E) to be executed in the process flow of your process.
