# Process Flow Toolbox

When defining the process flow of your processes, Service Studio provides the following Tools:

| Tool | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| ![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/start-process.png) Start | Starts the process flow. Only one Start element is allowed in a process flow. |
| ![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/conditional-start.png) Conditional Start | Starts an alternative flow in the process flow. How to use a [Conditional Start](https://github.com/danielmarquespt/docs-product/tree/e7ea3f444d5129dab245c69ab72ae091554bc4fb/src/ref/lang/auto/Class.Conditional%20Start.final.md%3E). |
| ![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/human-activity.png) Human Activity | Activity to be executed by a human being. How to use a [Human Activity](https://github.com/danielmarquespt/docs-product/tree/e7ea3f444d5129dab245c69ab72ae091554bc4fb/src/ref/lang/auto/Class.Human%20Activity.final.md%3E). |
| ![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/email-send.png) Send Email | Sends an Email to one or more recipients. How to use a [Send Email](https://github.com/danielmarquespt/docs-product/tree/e7ea3f444d5129dab245c69ab72ae091554bc4fb/src/ref/lang/auto/Class.Send%20Email.final.md%3E). |
| ![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/automatic-activity.png) Automatic Activity | Executes an action flow to do some work without the need of human intervention. How to use an [Automatic Activity](https://github.com/danielmarquespt/docs-product/tree/e7ea3f444d5129dab245c69ab72ae091554bc4fb/src/ref/lang/auto/Class.Automatic%20Activity.final.md%3E). |
| ![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/process.png) Execute Process | Executes another process as an activity of the current process. How to use an [Execute Process](https://github.com/danielmarquespt/docs-product/tree/e7ea3f444d5129dab245c69ab72ae091554bc4fb/src/ref/lang/auto/Class.Execute%20Process.final.md%3E). |
| ![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/wait-activity.png) Wait | Puts the process flow execution on hold until a specific event occurs. How to use a [Wait](https://github.com/danielmarquespt/docs-product/tree/e7ea3f444d5129dab245c69ab72ae091554bc4fb/src/ref/lang/auto/Class.Wait.final.md%3E). |
| ![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/decision.png) Decision | Branches the process flow path into multiple paths but only one is followed. How to use a [Decision](https://github.com/danielmarquespt/docs-product/tree/e7ea3f444d5129dab245c69ab72ae091554bc4fb/src/ref/lang/auto/Class.Decision.final.md%3E). |
| ![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/end-process.png) End | Ends the process flow. For a matter of organization, you can have more than one End element in the same process flow. How to use an [End](https://github.com/danielmarquespt/docs-product/tree/e7ea3f444d5129dab245c69ab72ae091554bc4fb/src/ref/lang/auto/Class.Process%20End.final.md%3E). |
| ![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/comment.png) Comment | Allows you to add comments to your process flow. |

Each process activity created in your process flow using a process tool has a life cycle.
