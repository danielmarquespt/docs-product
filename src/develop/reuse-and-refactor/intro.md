# Reuse and Refactor

As your applications grow organically from small to larger applications, you are challenged to keep your applications simple and easy to maintain.

Centralizing the logic in modular applications that can be reused by other applications within the environment makes it easier to continuously refactor your application portfolio as it grows.

OutSystems enables you to develop the logic and elements of your application modules in a centralized way so that they can be exposed and reused by other applications. On the other hand, OutSystems also provides you the mechanisms to manage in your modules the usage of the logic and elements exposed by other modules.
