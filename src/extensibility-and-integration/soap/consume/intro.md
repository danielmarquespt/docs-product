# Consuming SOAP Web Services

OutSystems provides support for consuming SOAP Web Services with WSDL 1.1 and SOAP 1.1/1.2.

 \*\*Note:\*\* The SOAP implementation available in previous versions, supporting up to SOAP 1.1, is now \*\*deprecated\*\*. This implementation is only used in modules that were upgraded to OutSystems 11; any new consumed SOAP web services in OutSystems 11 will use the new implementation. For documentation on this previous SOAP implementation check \[Consume a SOAP Web Service\]\(\) topic in OutSystems 10 documentation.
