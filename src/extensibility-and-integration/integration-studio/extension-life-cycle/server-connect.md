## Connecting to a Server

You can explicitly connect to a server or let Integration Studio prompt you to connect whenever you must be connected but are not; e.g. if you are publishing the extension. In both situations the [Select server window](https://github.com/danielmarquespt/docs-product/tree/e7ea3f444d5129dab245c69ab72ae091554bc4fb/src/ref/integration-studio/menu/file/server-select-window.md%3E) is displayed.

In the File menu or Toolbar, simply click Select server... ![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/connect-server%20%281%29.gif) and specify the parameters presented below.

## Connection Information

Once you are connected to a server, Integration Studio presents you information about the connection:

Title bar : Contains the name of the Platform Server you are connected to; for example `MyExtension@HubServer`.

Status bar : Contains the name of the Platform Server you are connected to and the username of the user that established the connection.
