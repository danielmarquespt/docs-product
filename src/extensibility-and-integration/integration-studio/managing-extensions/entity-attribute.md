# Entity Attributes

Once your entity is [created](https://github.com/danielmarquespt/docs-product/tree/e7ea3f444d5129dab245c69ab72ae091554bc4fb/src/extensibility-and-integration/integration-studio/managing-extensions/entity-define.md%3E), you can add, change, or delete its parameters in the [Entity Attributes Editor](https://github.com/danielmarquespt/docs-product/tree/e7ea3f444d5129dab245c69ab72ae091554bc4fb/src/ref/integration-studio/editor/action-parameters.md%3E).

You have to create the attributes according to the definition of the database table that you want to access in your application.
