# Define Extension Actions

Once you have created your extension you may define the actions exported by it. These actions allow you to use its functionality in a different application or technology.

To add an action to your extension, execute one of the following operations:

* [Add the action](https://github.com/danielmarquespt/docs-product/tree/e7ea3f444d5129dab245c69ab72ae091554bc4fb/src/extensibility-and-integration/integration-studio/managing-extensions/action-add.md%3E) manually to the extension.
* Import the action from a .NET assembly, through the [Import Actions from .Net Assembly](https://github.com/danielmarquespt/docs-product/tree/e7ea3f444d5129dab245c69ab72ae091554bc4fb/src/extensibility-and-integration/integration-studio/managing-extensions/net-assembly-import-action.md%3E) wizard.
