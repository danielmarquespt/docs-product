# Define Extension Entities

Once you have created your extension, simply define the **entities** exported by the extension. These entities allow you to use database tables that exist outside OutSystems.

![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/warning.gif) To publish a new extension that contains entities, your OutSystems user must have the "Allow External Entities" permission. Check with the Service Center administrator for a list of your permissions.

To add an entity to your extension, do one of the following operations:

* [Add the entity](https://github.com/danielmarquespt/docs-product/tree/e7ea3f444d5129dab245c69ab72ae091554bc4fb/src/extensibility-and-integration/integration-studio/managing-extensions/entity-add.md%3E) manually to the extension. 
* Import the entity definition from a database, through the [Import Entities from Database](https://github.com/danielmarquespt/docs-product/tree/e7ea3f444d5129dab245c69ab72ae091554bc4fb/src/extensibility-and-integration/integration-studio/managing-extensions/entity-import-from-database.md%3E) wizard.
