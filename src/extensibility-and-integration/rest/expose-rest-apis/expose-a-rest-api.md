# Expose a REST API

If you want to expose methods to allow other systems to retrieve or manipulate information, you can do it using a REST API.

## Create the REST API Service

1. In the **Logic** tab, open the **Integrations** folder. 
2. Right-click REST and select **Expose REST API...** 
3. Set the name of your REST API. Example: `PhoneBook` 

## Create the REST API Method

1. Right-click your REST API and choose **Add REST API Method**. 
2. Set the name of your REST API method. Examples: `GetContacts`, `CreateContact`, `UpdateContact`. 
3. Make sure the HTTP Method property is set to the HTTP verb corresponding to the action your method will perform:  
   * GET – Read 
   * POST – Create 
   * PUT – Update 
   * DELETE – Delete 
4. Design the method as an action that retrieves or manipulates the data you are exposing.  

    Examples: `GetContacts` will return the list of all Contacts, `CreateContact` or `UpdateContact` will receive a "Contact" record and return the "Id" of the created or updated contact. 

After deploying the application, your REST API endpoints will be accessible.

Examples:

| Default Endpoint | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `GET https://<server>/MyAPI/rest/PhoneBook/GetContacts` | Gets all contacts. |
| `GET https://<server>/MyAPI/rest/PhoneBook/GetContact` | Gets a contact. |
| `POST https://<server>/MyAPI/rest/PhoneBook/CreateContact` | Creates a contact. |
| `PUT https://<server>/MyAPI/rest/PhoneBook/UpdateContact` | Updates a contact. |
| `DELETE https://<server>/MyAPI/rest/PhoneBook/DeleteContact` | Deletes a contact. |
| `GET https://<server>/MyAPI/rest/PhoneBook/GetContactAddresses` | Gets all addresses of a contact. |

The default endpoints are based in the HTTP Method \(`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`\) and the name of the REST API Methods, but you can [customize the endpoints](https://github.com/danielmarquespt/docs-product/tree/e7ea3f444d5129dab245c69ab72ae091554bc4fb/src/extensibility-and-integration/rest/expose-rest-apis/customize-rest-urls.md%3E) according to your needs.

You can test your REST API Method using several available tools, such as [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/) or [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com), or building an OutSystems application for that effect.

For manipulation methods where the input parameter is a Record \(such as `POST` or `PUT`\), you will have to add the "Content-Type" header to the request, with the value `application/json`.
