# Gather User Feedback

OutSystems simplifies the whole change management process by allowing key users or internal QA users to share written and voice feedback right inside mobile and web applications.

You can enable feedback for all users or only to a restricted group of users. The feedback provided by the users is immediately available to the development team, which will be able to review all the submitted feedback and decide what changes to apply.

User feedback can be handled directly in OutSystems App Feedback application or you can integrate with your corporate tracking tools. Find out in OutSystems Community how our users are integrating with [JIRA](https://www.outsystems.com/forge/component/2153/feedback-to-jira/), [Zendesk](https://www.outsystems.com/forge/component/2154/feedback-to-zendesk/) or [Asana](https://www.outsystems.com/forge/component/2107/feedback-to-asana/).
