# Log data reference

This document lists the fields and descriptions of the database views associated with the platform log records. The views are built on top of the database tables.

 Also available: \[Log data reference in OutSystems 10\]\(https://success.outsystems.com/Documentation/10/Managing\_the\_Applications\_Lifecycle/Monitor\_and\_Troubleshoot/Logging\_database\_and\_architecture/Log\_data\_reference\).

## Mapping of the database views and Entities

You can access the log data in Service Studio, by using the PlatformLogs extension. Each entry has the corresponding \_Previous entry. For example, for the oslog\_General view you have both oslog\_General\_Previous in the database views and Log\_General\_Previous in the Entity list.
